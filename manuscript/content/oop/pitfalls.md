## Pitfalls
Unlike most sections to this book, in this one we focus more upon opinions then facts. As such the general format of a topic will be ignored.

Object Oriented Programming opens many doors and is definately a style of programming that all programmer should learn. But one key difference between OOP and other paradigms, is that OOP can get very messy fast.
With OOP design patterns are used to make code easy to understand, use and extend. The reality of the situation is that in a lot of cases it does not need to be extended or OOP via inhertiance is just the wrong tool for the job.
An alternative to OOP is Procedural. Procedural focusses upon free-functions and structs without methods. A great indicator of needing procedural style is using static methods in OOP. While D supports Procedural, OOP and functional paradigms, not all languages do.
Function style programming focusses more on function calls (as well as passing them around!) than on data structures.

Use the different paradigms sparingly, but there is one important point I'm trying to make. There is no silver bullet. A lot of people while learning programming view specific paradigms such as OOP as being the best thing since sliced bread. It's not, most of the time.

At this point understanding that there are other paradigms that can be used is more important then trying to learn all them.
