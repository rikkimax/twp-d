### Being a professional
A professional is much more then just a suit and tie. In fact as programmers that would be too formal for most occasional.
Being a professional is all about how you treat others and how you act in general. It is important to understand what this is in IT. As IT workers generally consider this an important topic.

Always aim to be a professional even when not working in a company. Otherwise you could end up being well known on the internet for running an open source project not only poorly but also against every best practice known to the industry while treating others like they know nothing. In other words, hated.

#### Professional Institutes
There are institutes which hold their members to a high standard within the IT community. Their goal is to further IT in some form. Such as getting more females into IT or creating a better IT work force in general.
They have generally a code of conduct that does have consequences if not followed.
These institutes are meant for while you are learning at e.g. a University and while in the workforce. They commonly have events that can be attended for both free and payed. Hiring managers at larger companies can be quite impressed by membership. As it shows dedication, competency and skill as an IT worker.
Some education institutions and companies may have partnerships with such organization making all members of staff members of the professional institute.

A great example of a professional institute is IITP[^IITPwebsite]. Almost everything above is done by IITP. They partner with education institutes such as CPIT[^CPITwebsite] and run events for members. There is also a code of conduct[^IITPCodeOfConduct].
If you are learning by yourself, a professional institute is probably not a good way to go at this point in time. Instead I would recommend focusing on getting into some form of online community such as D's to learn from. If you are at an education institute post high school, and a bit further down in your studies then a professional institute can help you get a job early on. Use the events as a way to network with others. Get to know your local workforce.

#### General rules to live by
A controversial rule of thumb for software developers is that we are everything to everyone in IT. Need a networker? We're it. Need a tester? We're it. Need that OS reinstalled, we got your back. Server failing to start a crucial service? We'll get it working.
In this way, being a programmer is far more difficult then any other job in IT, as a programmer we may be called upon to learn how to etch a PCB really fast and get the kit already to go. It may not be what you wanted to do in life. If you are able to just do these jobs well without complaining. Perhaps even enjoying it, you may find it to be the most rewarding part of the profession.
While this rule of thumb is great for most circumstances, a more concrete list is on the following page.

Some rules that any professional should work based upon:

1. Just because everybody else does it, doesn't mean you should

   You should at the best possible actions at every point. If others do shady work, you should aim to not be part of it or even to stop it. Such actions are not professional. By bettering yourself and your actions, everyone reaps the benefit. Just don't go over doing it.
2. Treat others with respect

   This should be pretty obvious, treat others with respect at all times. Even if you do not like them or if you happen to like them a little too much. Sexism and racism is against human rights and in quite a few countries illegal. In New Zealand there is the Human Rights Commission for these issues and they will enforce these rights.
3. Not all people think the same way

   In a world that is connected more so then ever before, expecting people from other cultures to behave like you do in your culture is offensive and ignorant. If in doubt ask. If you make a mistake apologize.
4. Make mistakes

   Mistakes will happen. Own up to them. Learn from them. Apologize if necessary. If you spend 1 million dollar inappropriately, you have just had a 1 million dollar training opportunity. Remember you cause it, you fix it! If possible, it will not always be possible to fix your mistakes and that's OK.
A lot of these are based upon IITP's code of conduct. The author recommends that the reader reads it if they are interested in this topic.
5. If you say you are going to do something, do it

   Basically do what you say. Say when you can't. But never be on the fence about doing something and not say so. If you are unable to do it, again say so. It is probably not up to you weather it is worth you learning it when in a company.
6. Keep learning

   I can't stress this one enough. Learn constantly. Have side projects. If your boss doesn't like it? Too bad! They need to understand that up skilling makes you a better programmer. In fact, it could one day benefit the company.
7. If you need something say so. Stick to it and don't back down

   There will be a lot of pressure within a company to do things cheaply, fast and to a high standard. A lot of employers and managers may not understand that a 10 year old consumer computer can't do what a new $5000+ server can do. Or push you into not requiring it when it is best practice or will be reasonably required.
8. Best practice, is relative

   When looking at best practice, things like coding standards will depend upon a community or company culture. For things like servers having enough performance wiggle room for increase in number of clients should be allowed for. Servers running at 100% constantly are not happy servers.
